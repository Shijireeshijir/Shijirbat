            In Forest Hills, Queens, New York City,[49] Midtown High School
            student Peter Benjamin Parker is a science-whiz orphan living with
            his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. As depicted in Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug.
            1962), he is bitten by a radioactive spider (erroneously classified
            as an insect in the panel) at a science exhibit and "acquires the
            agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid".[50] Along with
            heightened athletic abilities, Parker gains the ability to adhere to
            walls and ceilings. Through his knack for science, he develops a
            gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through
            small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his
            new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as "Spider-Man", becomes a
            novelty television star. However, "[h]e blithely ignores the chance
            to stop a fleeing thief, [and] his indifference ironically catches
            up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle
            Ben." Spider-Man tracks and subdues the killer and learns, in the
            story's next-to-last caption, "With great power there must also
            come—great responsibility!"[51]

            Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books
            published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and
            artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book
            Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books.
            He has been featured in comic books, television shows, films, video
            games, novels, and plays. Spider-Man's secret identity is Peter
            Benjamin Parker, a teenage high school student and an orphan raised
            by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents
            Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the
            character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial
            issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash
            Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests
            Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as
            the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom. In his origin story,
            Spider-Man gets his superhuman spider-powers and abilities after
            being bitten by a radioactive spider; these include superhuman
            strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and
            balance, clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a spider, and
            detecting danger with his precognition ability called
            "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that
            shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both
            for fighting and for web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker
            originally used his powers for his own personal gain, but after his
            Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that Peter could not stop, he began
            to use his powers to fight crime by becoming Spider-Man. When
            Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero
            comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the
            protagonist. The Spider-Man comic series broke ground by featuring
            Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as
            Spider-Man's secret identity, whose "self-obsessions with rejection,
            inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could
            relate.[8] While Spider-Man was a quintessential sidekick, unlike
            previous teen heroes Bucky Barnes and Robin, Spider-Man had no
            superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he had learned the
            lesson for himself that "with great power comes great
            responsibility"—a line included in a text box in the final panel of
            the first Spider-Man's origin story, but later retroactively
            attributed to the late Uncle Ben Parker.
